# amount of time take for the algorithm to solve a problem
# time complexity


# - time efficient (performance) -> increase and got cheaper
# - space efficient -> increase and got cheaper


# 1MB -> 2KB/s
# speed of solving problem

# find Big O Notation for n students algorithm

students = 'akash', 'bryan', 'theo', 'kim'

for s in students:
    print(s) # O(x)

# n items
# O(n)
# n * O(x) -> O(n)

# m items
# O(m) -> linear complexity


# Good case scenario <-> worse case scenario
